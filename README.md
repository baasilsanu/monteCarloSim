## README.md

Simple program to derive the probabilites of the Monty Hall problem. The right solution (which was highly controversial) is 
derived here using the Monte Carlo method. 

Details of the problem can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

The program correctly concludes that switching is the correct strategy, with a win probability of 66%, while sticking to the 
original door has a win probablity of 33%.
